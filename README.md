This is for [Introduction to MongoDB](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-mongodb/home/welcome).  
As the configuration procedure is cumbersome, it may be helpful to share some 'how-to' infos.   
I wil add more content as I proceed with the course.

Seems that 'host' in import.sh is not the same string that is used to connect mongo shell to server.
Do replace that string with one or all servers in your cluster or import.sh will not work.
